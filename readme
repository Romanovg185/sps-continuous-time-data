Figures:
EPS of 4-box plots.
Cerebellum and cortex are placed on individual boxes.

TotalKernelSums:
Measured at a 1ms time scale per point because of hyperaccuity

FRIOnsetTimes:
Each column represents a cell.
Every row corresponds to a single inferred complex spiking event.
NaN padded to be rectangular.

IntervalsSignificantCorrelation:
First column contains start time in seconds of an event that is considered p<0.05 significant.
Second column contains end times.

SynchronousEventParticipatingNeurons:
Columns represent synchronouse events, i.e. time intervals where the kernel-sum is 2sigma above the mean.
Rows represent cells.
A 1 is placed if this cell fires in the corresponding synchronous event.
The absolute time intervals in seconds are stored in IntervalsSignificantCorrelation

Selection criterion:
In order to select an interval of significant correlation, a ground truth is used. This ground truth is formed individually for M Cbl cells and N Ctx cells. To do this, we randomly sample a Cbl cell N times, shuffle it in time and let this be the new onset times. We do similar for Ctx. Then, the kernel sum for these are computed and added to form kernel_sum_surrogate. The threshold for an event is mean(kernel_sum_surrogate) + 2*std(kernel_sum_surrogate).
All cells inside an interval of significant correlation are considered to partake in this event.
To form the graph, a manual threshold of minimum number of correlation events a cell has to partake in has to be set. This also determines the indices.

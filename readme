Figures:
EPS of 4-box plots.
The individual EPS are scaled individually, so unable to compare color hues.
Cerebellum and cortex are placed on individual boxes.

FRIOnsetTimes:
Each column represents a cell.
Every row corresponds to a single inferred complex spiking event.
NaN padded to be rectangular.

IntervalsSignificantCorrelation:
First column contains start time in seconds of an event that is considered p<0.05 significant.
Second column contains end times.

SynchronousEventParticipatingNeurons:
Columns represent synchronouse events, i.e. time intervals where the kernel-sum is 2sigma above the mean.
Rows represent cells.
A 1 is placed if this cell fires in the corresponding synchronous event.
The absolute time intervals in seconds are stored in IntervalsSignificantCorrelation

SynchronousEventParticipatingNeurons:
Columns represent synchronouse events, i.e. time intervals where the kernel-sum is 2sigma above the mean.
Rows represent cells.
A 1 is placed if this cell fires in the corresponding synchronous event.
The absolute time intervals in seconds are stored in IntervalsSignificantCorrelation
